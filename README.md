### What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

### Why Linear Regression is Important?
The model’s equation provides clear coefficients that elucidate the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. Its simplicity is a virtue, as linear regression is transparent, easy to implement, and serves as a foundational concept for more complex algorithms.
### Math Formula
This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:
y=β0+β1Xy=β0​+β1​X
where:

    Y is the dependent variable
    X is the independent variable
    β0 is the intercept
    β1 is the slope

  ### What is the best Fit Line?
  Our primary objective while using linear regression is to locate the best-fit line, which implies that the error between the predicted and actual values should be kept to a minimum. There will be the least error in the best-fit line.

The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).
